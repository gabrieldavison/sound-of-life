          is a zero player game. A living cell is represented by a green square
          on the board and a dead cell is represented by a black square. Each
          round the state of a cell is decided by three simple rules.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Any cell with two or three live neighbours stays alive.</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours comes to life.</li>
          <li>
            Any live cell with less than 2 live neighbours or more than three
            becomes dies.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A cells neighbours are the 8 cells that surround it.</p>
        <p>
          Although the setup of the game is simple some extremely complex
          patterns can be created. People have built some

          To use this implementation of the game set the board to your desired
          width and height using the number inputs. Then place your living cells
          by clicking on the board. You may also want to place cells randomly
          using the randomize button. When you are ready click the start button
          to begin the game.
